In this HDL repository, there are many different and unique modules, consisting
of various HDL (Verilog or VHDL) components. The individual modules are
developed independently, and may be accompanied by separate and unique license
terms (such as GPL, LGPL, BSD, modified BSD, commercial or others). Your license
rights with respect to individual modules accompanied by separate license terms
are defined by those terms. The license agreement for each module is generally
located in the module source code. Nothing else shall restrict, limit, or
otherwise affect any rights or obligations you may have, or conditions to which
you may be subject, under such license terms. This agreement does not limit your
rights under, or grant you rights that supersede, the license terms of any
particular module.

The mere aggregation of these modules (putting them side by side in the same
source code repository or on a hard disk) does not mean that there is one master
license for all the files. It is up to you, the user, to ensure that during the
building a project, which combines these modules together so that they form a
bit file (either one, or multiple for partial reconfiguration), all the individual
licenses are compatible. For example, if a single module is covered by the GPL,
the whole combination must also be released under the GPL. If you can't, or
won't, do that, you may not distribute the resulting bit file.

The majority of ADI created modules are dual-licensed, allowing the user to pick
which license they want to use, (and the rights and obligations they have).
    - The ADI BSD license, which allows you to make bit files, and not release your
      source, as long as it attaches to an ADI device. This is not truly open
      source, since it does place extra restrictions on developers.
    - The GPL v2 license, which allows you to make bit files, but you must release
      all other HDL (except vendor produced, which we consider as a run-time library),
      permitted by GPL section 3, along with your bit file. This is truly open
      source, and places no additional restrictions on use or fields of endeavor. The
      GPL is ideal for use cases such as open source projects with open source
      distribution, student/academic purposes, hobby projects, internal research
      projects without external distribution, or other projects where all GPL
      obligations can be met.

In these cases, support is handled via web (https://ez.analog.com/community/fpga),
on a best effort basis. Note that our best efforts may not match your product
development schedule. This is a free, non-deterministic support, and is not meant
as a replacement for professional services. However, if this is not adequate
for your needs, or you require support within a specific time frame we recommend
you seek alternatives including seeking professional service and/or commercial/deterministic
support.

There are also specific modules which are only single-licensed, as listed
below. This list may not be complete, it's up to the user to check each module
license.
    - SPDIF, which is released under the LGPL license only. See
      https://opencores.org/project,spdif_interface for support.
    - The ADI created JESD Core, which is released under the GPL and a commercial
      license only.
       + The commercial license gives you the full rights to create and distribute
         bit files on your own terms without any open source license obligations,
         and special avenues for support may be possible. If you are interested
         in such a license, contact us at jesd204-licensing@analog.com for more
         information.
